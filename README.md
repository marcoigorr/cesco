# Cesco

This is a variant of [_Insanity_](https://github.com/marcoigorr/Insanity) used to cheat at PTSA exams.

## Usage
- Press key '1', '2' or '3' --> to choose the exam part

- ress key '0' --> to write each line until the array is finished

This program automatically writes words in order to pass the exam, you only need to use the mouse and choose where you want the script to write.

Once executed press 1, 2 or 3 to initialize the part of the script that corresponds to the exam part... Then press 0 to write out the first line (then you need to press enter)
